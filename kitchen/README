Developement environment

    Cygwin 8.3.1-1

    gcc (GCC) 10.2.0

    GNU gdb (GDB) (Cygwin 8.3.1-1) 8.3.1

    boost_1_71_0

1. How to configure Makefile

    variable boost in Makefile need to be changed to actual boost directory
    I had boost library built by myself. so boost:=/home/zhangl/boost_bd

2. How to build

    run make in this directory, two binaries unit_test and cli generated

    if link error shows, please run export PATH=$PATH:"/home/zhangl/boost_bd/bin"
    or add it to your .bashrc with the actual boost directory then make again

3. How to do unit test

    run command ./unit_test , it will show test result.

4. How to do kitchen system simulation

    run command ./cli -f orders.json -R 2
    then kitchen simulation begins, log will be shown on console

5. Design decision

    for adding, finding, removing an order in a shelf as quickly as possible,
    double linked list and hash map are used at the same time. std::list and
    std::unordered_map is suitable choice.

    overflow shelf need random access, if it is full and randomly select and 
    discard an order. std::vector does not suit, because of an order removed,
    some or even all indece will be invalid. boost::stable_vector is reasonable
    choice.

    for courier management, priority queue based on heap, with courier`s arriving
    time as key value is suitable. boost::heap::priority_queue is a reasonable 
    candidate.

    when adding an order, if its destination shelf and overflow shelf are full.
    moving orders from overflow shelf to other shelves is needed passively. 
    this action is more time-consuming than other operation. it may make other
    threads waiting. positive policy is to make it as routine, if other shelves 
    are valid, then move orders from overflow shelf into them. those two policies
    are all implemented.
